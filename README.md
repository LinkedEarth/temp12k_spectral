# Spectral Analysis of the Temp12k database

## Data

The data used in this study comes from the global database of Holocene paleotemperature record ([Temp12k](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3)). The database is available in the [LiPD format](https://lipd.net) and available through a graph database, [the LiPDGraph](https://linkedearth.graphdb.mint.isi.edu). 

## Software

This notebook makes use of the [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Goal

[Zhu et al. (2019)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1809959116) show that there is broad agreement in scaling behavior between model and proxy data (and among proxy records) over the past millennium. This notebook extends this study over the Holocene to look at scaling behavior among various types of proxy records.
